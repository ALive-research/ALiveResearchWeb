Do you want to work in the growing sector of medical technology? Do you want to
start your career in a network of leading universities, research centers and
hospitals? The Intervention Centre, at Oslo University Hospital is the leading
organization for the project ALive, and has connection with several European
universities, research institutions and industrial partners. We are looking for
excellent candidates to join us for a 3-year fully funded PhD program.

### Working environment

The Intervention Centre is a unique cross-disciplinary research and development
department, part of Oslo University Hospital (Oslo, Norway). The center has a
long trajectory of research and development in the fields of minimally invasive
surgery and medical technology for cardiac and abdominal interventions
applications. In addition, it counts with cutting edge operating rooms used for
both regular patients treatment and research. These facilities integrating
intra-operative CT and MR imaging, are not only unique in Norway, but one of the
few of its type in the world. At The Intervention Centre, engineers, students
and clinical personell collaborate and exchange experiences to solve a wide
variety of challenges in healthcare. We encourage researchers, regardless of the
background (clinical or technical) to attend and learn from real clinical
procedures to aquire an invaluable experience and full immersion in real
clinical environments.The Intervention Centre is placed in Rikshospitalet and
Gaustad Sykehus both located in the north of the city of Oslo, bordering with
the NordMarka forest which offers peaceful surroundings close to nature and
popular recreation areas in both summer and winter seasons.


### About the position and the PhD program

In this project, the focus of the PhD program will be **computational analysis
and planning of liver resection procedures**. In this context, computational
geometrical modeling, theory of splines and image processing are going to be
core disciplines of the training. In addition, and following the current trends
in computing, the use of deep-learning, while not essential, it is encouraged
for some of the parts of the project. The ambition of the project is that the
research results are translated to real-world applications; in ALive, we have
software support to help on the implementation of the research results into
open-source software platforms like 3D Slicer. This will give the candidate, the
opportunity to acquire competences in implementation of medical technology. The
project has national and international partners that will be working on the
ALive project under different angles and it is expected that the candidate will
have a good national and internationa collaborative environment. 

This position adheres to the Norwegian Goverment's policy of balanced ethnicity
and gender. Persons with inmigrant background are encouraged to apply. Oslo
University Hospital's objective is to increase the number of females in
