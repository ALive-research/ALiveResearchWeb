Fund seeking is part of the everyday life in pretty much every research group.
While successful attempts are very rewarding, most of the research proposals
concurring to a funding call, don't get funded. Fortunately, the ALive project,
has become one of these successful proposasl getting funded by [The Research
Council of Norway][research-council] through the [IKT-Pluss program][iktpluss].

Through that program, the ALive project has been granted **15M NOK** that will
help us supporting **2 PhD students** and **2 Pos-Doctoral researchers**
full-time, as well as their research activities, for three years starting from
October 2020.

project visit the [People](/people) section.
