Planning liver surgical resections is an extremely complex task. In this
process, surgeons decide the trajectory separating the healthy part of the liver
from the part that will be resected. Despite being practiced for decades, among
surgerons, there is still no consensus on what a good liver resection is. An
underlying problem contributing to this lack of consensus is the fact that there
are no formal methods to specify and communicate resection plsns—clinicians
often use subjective descriptions (written or oral) or hand-drawings.

In ALive, we believe that liver surgical practice needs computer-assisted tools
allowing the surgeons to specify resection plans in a flexible way, thus
accommodating different surgery planning techniques and cultures. We also
believe that providing a way to represent resections in a formal way can
contribute to a better evaluation and communication of resection plans.


# What is ALive?

ALive is a research project funded by the
[**IKTPluss**](https://www.forskningsradet.no/en/about-the-research-council/programmes/iktpluss/)
program from [**The Research Council of
Norway**](https://www.forskningsradet.no/en/).

ALive aims to improve liver surgery practice by researching new methods
for planning and visualization of liver resections. The project will
work on two different areas:

* Generation of resection plans using **geometric modeling**,
  **AI** and **vasculature analysis**.
  
* **Formal representation** and **visualization** of 3D resections in
  lower dimensions (2D).

# Project organization
The project is coordinated by [**Oslo University
Hospital**](https://oslo-universitetssykehus.no/oslo-university-hospital)
and has the participation of [**NTNU**](https://www.ntnu.no/),
[**SINTEF Digital**](https://www.sintef.no/en/digital/) and
[**University of Córdoba**](https://www.uco.es).

ALive is organized in a set of **work packages**, a **collaboration unit** and
an **advisory board** (see figure below). Two of the work packages
(**WP1**&mdash;*Liver Resection Planning* and **WP2**&mdash;*Liver Analytics
and Visualization*) structure the core scientific work. These work
packages will be supported by (**WP0**&mdash;*Project Management* and
**WP3**&mdash;*Clinical Support*).

In ALive, we believe that research software can accelerate scientific discovery
and increase the impact. In this line, we plan to close the gap between research
concepts and software by implementing our results using the open-source platform
3D Slicer.
