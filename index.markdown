# What is ALive?

ALive is a research project funded by the
[**IKTPluss**](https://www.forskningsradet.no/en/about-the-research-council/programmes/iktpluss/)
program from [**The Research Council of
Norway**](https://www.forskningsradet.no/en/).

ALive aims to improve liver surgery practice by researching new methods
for planning and visualization of liver resections. The project will
work on two different areas:

* Generation of resection plans using **geometric modeling**,
  **AI** and **vasculature analysis**.
  
* **Formal representation** and **visualization** of resections.
