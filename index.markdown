# What is ALive?

ALive is a research project funded by the
[**IKTPluss**](https://www.forskningsradet.no/en/about-the-research-council/programmes/iktpluss/)
program from [**The Research Council of
Norway**](https://www.forskningsradet.no/en/).

ALive aims to improve liver surgery practice by researching new methods
for planning and visualization of liver resections. The project will
work on two different areas:

* Generation of resection plans using **geometric modeling**,
  **AI** and **vasculature analysis**.
  
* **Formal representation** and **visualization** of 3D resections in
  lower dimensions (2D).

# Project organization
The project is coordinated by [**Oslo University
Hospital**](https://oslo-universitetssykehus.no/oslo-university-hospital)
and has the participation of [**NTNU**](https://www.ntnu.no/),
[**SINTEF Digital**](https://www.sintef.no/en/digital/) and
[**University of CÃ³rdoba**](https://www.uco.es).

ALive is organized in a set of **work packages**, a **collaboration unit** and
an **advisory board** (see figure below). Two of the work packages
(**WP1**&mdash;*Liver Resection Planning* and **WP2**&mdash;*Liver Analytics
and Visualization*) structure the core scientific work. These work
packages will be supported by (**WP0**&mdash;*Project Management* and
**WP3**&mdash;*Clinical Support*)
